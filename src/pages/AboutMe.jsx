                <h1>Hello, my name is Maya Chakravarty</h1>
                <p>
                I am a recent graduate from St. John's University with a Bachelor of Applied Science - BASc in Computer Science.
                I am pursuing a career in Full Stack Development and have recently completed a certification course from Columbia Engineering
                in Full Stack working with essential languages, libraries and platforms for web development. 
                My academic background has prepared me prioritizing a strong understanding of data structures and algorithms, 
                database management, application development, and software design methods.
